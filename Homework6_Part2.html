<h2>Amelia Loeffler</h2>
<h3> Using the same data as in the previous homework, I made a ratio of the number of households receiving SNAP benefits and the total number of households in each county.  </h3>

    <h4> For this map I used the equal count (quartile) mode to categorize the data. An advantage of this method is that it's easy to interpret becauses there are no missing values or gaps in the values. A disadvantage is that it doesn't consider how data is distributed on a number line, so lots of data can fall into one category. </h4>

    <h4> For this map I used the Natural Breaks mode to categorize the data. An advantage of this method is that it maximizes the differences between groups of data, so it works well for data that has lots of variance. A downside is that it does not work well for data with low variance. </h4>

        <h4> For this map I used the pretty breaks mode to categorize the data. The downside of this map is that when there are too many similar colors it can be hard for the reader to differentiate between them. </h4>
